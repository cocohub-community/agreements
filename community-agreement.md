# CoCoHub Community Agreement

## 1. Purpose

CoCoHub believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, political view or preferred diet.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for community members (namely digital nomads) behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all members to help us realize a safe and positive community experience for everyone.

## 2. Open And Decentralized  Community Approach

CoCoHub is the first decentralized global coliving & coworking community for digital nomads. We enable individuals to kick-start local communities of location independent professionals within their cities.

We strongly believe in natural human interactions over real estate investments by creating digital nomad neighborhoods all around the world, where everyone is able to join in.

A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to increase open communities by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the community at large.

CoCoHub acts as a global non-commercial community layer for local digital nomad communities, coworking and coliving spaces. In service of this goal, CoCoHub community members will be recognized on our website https://cocohub.io via a short profile. 

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. You can nominate other members to become local ambassadors on https://ambassadors.cocohub.io

## 3. Expected Behavior

Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow digital nomads. 
Present yourself in an authentic and active way. In doing so, our community members spread the word about CoCoHub, and thus the digital nomad movement, globally as well as locally. 


## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any community members of CoCoHub and related community-driven events. All CoCoHub events may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations as well as local culture. Our worldview is never superior to that of the people who call a particular location their home, yet we always represent the values of freedom and a self-determined way of life.

We strongly discourage community members from seeing and presenting themselves as spiritual leaders or gurus in any way. The community members strive to learn from each other through empowerment, knowledge sharing and honest meaningful “offline-first” interactions. 

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## 5. Consequences Of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other community members, community members, partners, or other patrons of CoCoHub.Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. 

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, CoCoHub may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the global CoCoHub organizer as soon as possible.

The local CoCoHub ambassador as well as all community members will be available to assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior online respectively offline to feel safe. Ambassadors will be wearing shirts or hoodies identifying them as the community leaders, so anyone can reach out to them during community activities and events.

## 7. Scope

We expect all community members to abide by this code of conduct.
